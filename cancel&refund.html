                <p class="sample-text">Since we have been dealing with this business for ages, we know that there are the type of clients who book their flight tickets but either ask for some changes in it or cancel the same due to any unexpected reasons. This may lead to severe loss to our company and thus, to cope-up with such kinds of situations, we have kept our policies very simple.</p>
                <p class="sample-text">The amount of almost all the flight tickets are non-refundable after 24 hours of making your online payment. Since we have no physical location, all cancellations could be made only via our customer care support and you need to follow the terms and conditions to fall under such categories to get your cancellations and refunds accepted. Such terms and conditions are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li class="sample-text">You need to follow the timeline to request for flight cancellation</li>
                    <li class="sample-text">You need to inform our customer care support immediately instead of directly missing your flight</li>
                    <li class="sample-text">Following such terms and conditions means you could get some waivers if applicable or if the airlines will get agreed</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Process of Flight Cancellation:</h3>

                <p class="sample-text">We at faresmatch.com have set up a specific process for each and every single service and thus, you need to follow such a process to request for flight cancellation. Once after requesting our customer care support for cancellation, your ticket will be checked and thereafter, you will get an email notifying about the cancellation. This email notification will only be the confirmation of your request being received by us intimating you about your cancellation reference id with the help of which you can easily track the status of your request. Later on, you will get a decision whether you are eligible for the refund or not but it is confirmed that any service fee being levied on flight bookings will surely be not â€“refundable.</p>
                <p class="sample-text">In case you will be eligible for the refund, it will take around- working days to get your amount credited either to the original payment source or you will get the same in the form of travel credit. In such a case, there is a minimal deduction as cancellation fee and such amount may depend upon the type of ticket.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">Faresmatch.com always suggests all its clients to read the terms and conditions thoroughly before finalizing your flight tickets so as to avoid any unwanted hassles in future. Go through all the policies once as everything is clearly mentioned on our website.</p>
