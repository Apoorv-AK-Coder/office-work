                    <h3>Tips for Effective Flight Booking:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Advance Booking – </b>Early booking is the right approach to finding closer deals for your travel date.</li>
                        <li><b>Deals Comparison – </b>Due to the wide range of airlines and websites, you have a choice to compare the price of airline tickets to grab the best deals. Always keep one thing in mind: every platform has different deals and reservations.</li>
                        <li><b>Scheduling Flexible— </b>If it is possible to travel on weekdays, then make sure to choose these days because the price of a ticket is competitively low compared to weekend prices.</li>
                        <li><b>Discounts and Deals— </b>On the other hand, many discounts and deals are applicable as per the terms and conditions of your booking criteria.</li>
                        <li><b>Find Some Alternative Airports – </b>Be smart and try to choose alternative airports rather than popular airports to find economical flight options.</li>
                        <li><b></b></li>
                        <li><b></b></li>
                        <li><b>Know Your Baggage Fees - </b>Never overpay for the flight because of the baggage fee. An extra baggage fee is an unexpected cost of travel. </li>
                        <li><b>Be Familiar with Your Airline Policy - </b>Before booking, you must be familiar with the airline's online policies and other important terms.</li>
                        <li><b>Keep all travel documents - </b>Never make a mess with your travel documents, and keep all the major things at one place.</li>
                    </ul>
