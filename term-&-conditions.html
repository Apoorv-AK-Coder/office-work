                    accuracy, integrity, or completeness of the content provided on the Autoxexpert.com website or the
                    products or services offered for sale on the website. Furthermore, Autoxexpert makes no

                    appropriate for use outside of the United States. Autoxexpert and its Associates expressly disclaim
                    all warranties for the website and its products, whether expressed or implied, including but not
                    limited to warranties of title, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. No oral advice
                    or written information given by Autoxexpert or its Associates shall create a warranty. Some states
                    do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties, so the above limitation or exclusion
                    may not apply to you.</p>
                <h3>Intended for Users Over 18</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">The Autoxexpert.com website is intended for use by individuals aged 18 years or
                    older. It is not directed for use by children under 18. Users under the age of 18 should seek
                    assistance from a parent or guardian to use this site. By accessing the website, you represent that
                    you are at least 18 years old or are visiting under the supervision of a parent or guardian.</p>
                <h3>Product Display</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">Autoxexpert.com strives to display product images on the site as accurately as
                    possible. However, we cannot guarantee that the display you see matches the product, as the display
                    of the product may depend on third-party information.</p>
                <h3>Errors on Our Site</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">Prices and availability of products and services are subject to change without
                    notice. Errors will be corrected where discovered, and Autoxexpert reserves the right to revoke any
                    stated offer and correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including after an order has been
                    submitted and whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your
                    credit card has already been charged and your order is canceled, Autoxexpert will issue a credit to
                    your credit card account for the amount of the charge. Individual bank policies will dictate when
                    this amount is credited to your account. If you are not fully satisfied with your purchase, you may
                    return it in accordance with Autoxexpert’s Return Policy.</p>
                <h3>Sales Tax Policy</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">Autoxexpert collects and remits sales tax as required by U.S. law for
                    transactions on Autoxexpert.com. If you are a tax-exempt entity, you may take advantage of
                    tax-exempt status for applicable purchases made on Autoxexpert.com.</p>
                <h3>Paying for Your Order</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">You may pay for your orders with major credit cards issued in the United States,
                    including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover Card.<br>
                    We may pre-authorize your order amount with your credit or debit card issuer when you place the
                    order, which may affect your available credit line. Please contact your credit card issuer for more
                    information.</p>
                <h3>Validating Your Order</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">After you place an order using our shopping cart, we will verify your information
                    for validity by checking your payment method or shipping address. We reserve the right to reject any
                    order you place and/or limit quantities on any order without giving any reason. If we reject your
                    order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail address you provided with the order.<br>
                    Your credit or debit card will not normally be charged if we reject an order, but we will process a
                    refund if the charge has been made against your card.</p>
                <h3>Order Acceptance/Confirmation</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not
                    signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell.
                    Autoxexpert reserves the right to accept or decline your order at any time after receipt of your
                    order.</p>
                <h3>Return Policy</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">All sales made through the Autoxexpert.com website are subject to Autoxexpert’s
                    return policy.<br>
                    Most of our parts come with a 30-day exchange-only warranty. Please contact your salesperson to
                    confirm the guarantee with your part purchase. Refunds are given with approval only.<br>
                    Body parts and cuts are non-refundable and sold AS-IS without any warranty expressed or implied.<br>
                    Unless otherwise stated, electrical parts and computers are sold AS-IS without any warranty
                    expressed or implied.<br>
                    All deposits, whether for Special Orders or not, are non-refundable unless otherwise stated.<br>
                    In special cases, we may charge a 25% cancellation fee if a part has been ordered, processed, and
                    then canceled by the customer. This fee will be deducted from the deposit made by the customer if
                    approved by management. Keep in mind that cancellations are pending management approval, and this
                    policy may not be stated on the customer’s invoice.<br>
                    To be eligible for an exchange, your item must be unused and in the same condition as when you
                    received it. It must also be in the original packaging.<br>
                    To complete your return, we require the original receipt or proof of purchase.</p>
                <h3>Order Limitations</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">We reserve the right to reject any order you place and/or limit quantities on any
                    order without giving any reason. If we reject your order, we will generally attempt to notify you
                    using the e-mail address you provided when placing the order.</p>
                <h3>Shipping</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">All orders placed on this site are subject to product availability and will be
                    shipped according to Autoxexpert’s shipping policies.<br>
                    In the rare event that your order never arrives, notification of lost items must be received within
                    60 days from receipt of the shipping confirmation e-mail.</p>
                <h3>Termination of Use</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">Autoxexpert may, at its sole discretion, terminate your account or your use of
                    the Autoxexpert.com website at any time. You are personally liable for any orders you place or
