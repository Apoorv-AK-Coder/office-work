                        <p class="sample-text">We act solely as an intermediary for the airlines listed in your itinerary and are not responsible for their actions or omissions. We are not liable for any delays, failures, or service issues caused by airlines, governmental authorities, or external factors such as labor disputes, mechanical failures, pandemics, weather conditions, or other unforeseen events.</p>

                        <p class="sample-text">We do not provide specific information about foreign entry requirements or safety conditions. For details on travel risks, entry requirements, and health advisories, please consult the State Department’s travel website and the CDC’s travel resources. It is your responsibility to ensure that you meet all travel document and entry requirements.</p>

                        <h3 class="sample-text">Airline Schedule Changes and Delays</h3>
                        <p class="sample-text">Flight schedule changes and delays can occur frequently. We recommend checking flight times regularly. Airlines are not required to compensate for delays, so we suggest purchasing travel insurance. In the event of a cancellation, contact the airline first and, if necessary, reach out to us for ticket confirmation or replacement.</p>

                        <p class="sample-text">If an airline cancels your flight or if you cancel your booking, we will issue a future travel credit equivalent to your payment. This credit is valid for one year and can be used for any international ticket. No credit is given for no-shows.</p>

                        <p class="sample-text">You agree to use our services for legitimate bookings only. Speculative or fraudulent reservations, or using tickets for unused segments, are not permitted. We do not guarantee that airlines will honor tickets purchased in this manner.</p>

                    <li>
