                    Failure to update your phone number may result in your messages being sent to the wrong person, and
                    GlobalAirGuide.com is not responsible for any issues arising from outdated contact information.
                </p>

                <h3>Obligatory Conflict Resolution</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">
                    Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver
                </p>
                <p class="sample-text">
                    Please read this section carefully. It affects your legal rights, including your right to file a
                    lawsuit in court and to participate in a class action. By enrolling in GlobalAirGuide.com’s text
                    messaging service, you agree to resolve any disputes through binding arbitration rather than in
                    court.
                </p>

                <h3>Pre-Dispute Resolution Process</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">
                    If a dispute arises between you and GlobalAirGuide.com, we are committed to resolving it through a
                    pre-dispute resolution process. This involves:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="sample-text">
                        <b>Notice of Dispute: </b>
                        You must notify us in writing of any dispute within one year of the occurrence. Send the notice
                        to our designated email address with your name, contact information, a description of the
                        dispute, and the relief sought.
                    </li>
                    <li class="sample-text">
                        <b>Informal Negotiations: </b>
                        We will attempt to resolve the dispute through informal negotiations, including discussions and
                        a potential settlement conference.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Arbitration Process</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">
                    If the dispute cannot be resolved informally, it will be resolved through binding arbitration.
                    Arbitration is a less formal process than a lawsuit in court, and it involves a neutral third-party
                    arbitrator. Key points include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li class="sample-text">
                        <b>No Judge or Jury: </b>
                        There is no judge or jury in arbitration.
                    </li>
                    <li class="sample-text">
                        <b>Limited Discovery: </b>
                        The process is more streamlined with limited discovery and fewer procedural rules.
                    </li>
                    <li class="sample-text">
                        <b>Individual Relief: </b>
                        The arbitrator can only award relief specific to the individual, not to a class or group.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Class Action Waiver:</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">
                    You agree that any arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis and not as a class action,
                    and you waive the right to participate in a class action or any representative proceeding
                </p>

                <h3>Governing Law:</h3>
                <p class="sample-text">
                    The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration
                    agreement.
                </p>
